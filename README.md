# Shipmondo's official PHP library

This SDK supports Shipmondo API v3.

Specification: https://app.shipmondo.com/api/public/v3/specification

**Note:** If you want to upgrade from [pakkelabels-php-sdk](https://github.com/pakkelabels/pakkelabels-php-sdk) please refer to [this section](#migrating-from-pakkelabels-php-sdk)

## Getting started

Below is a simple PHP script which illustrate the minimum amount of code needed to getting started.

```php5
<?php
  try {
    $client = new Shipmondo('api_user', 'api_key');
  } catch (ShipmondoException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
  }
?>
```

Once the $client object is created, you can begin to use the API.

## Migrating from pakkelabels-php-sdk

If you have used the [pakkelabels-php-sdk](https://github.com/pakkelabels/pakkelabels-php-sdk) library and you want to upgrade to shipmondo_php_sdk, you have to do as follows:
- Change _Pakkelabels.php_ to _Shipmondo.php_ in any require you use
- Change references to the _Pakkelabels_ and _PakkelabelsException_ class to _Shipmondo_ and _ShipmondoException_
- All function calls must be changes to camelCase i.e. _create\_shipment_ -> _createShipment_
- All GET function calls must add _get_ in front of, as well as camelCase i.e. _account\_balance_ -> _getAccountBalance_
